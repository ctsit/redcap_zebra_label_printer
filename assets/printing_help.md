## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting: Misaligned Labels**

If your labels print misaligned, follow these calibration steps:

1. Ensure the **yellow sensor** behind the print roller is centered under the labels.
2. Press and hold both the **Pause** and **Cancel** buttons on the printer for 2 seconds. The printer will automatically roll out and calibrate the labels.
